Looking at the programs for the first assignment:
1) I like you thinking about interpolation already - it made the derivatives much smoother especially for that sin function.
2) The goal I have for you is to learn to use the vector properties python and MATLAB - you write too many for loops when if you think it terms of arrays, you can simplify your code and make it run faster.
